# Voyage-Ventures

![Main.jpg](Main.jpg)


This is our DataBase Management (DBS) project. We made this project for the final evaluation of the DBS lab held in the 4th semester.
It is a full fledged travel management system designed to make the whole process of planning and booking their dream holiday easier. 

Team members- 
- Anutham Krishnan
- Aditya Verma
- Sahil Khose
- Sankalp Shubham

All of us contributed equally in the ER diagram and normalization process. Although, the frontend was handled majorly by Anutham and Sahil. Making the frontend (which included all the forms, UI and integration) in C# was a bit of challenge but our teammates did a really good job.

Backend work(Sql database, maintaining data and relevant functions, procedures and queries) was mainly handled by Aditya and Sankalp.

The project was a fun and overwhelming experience. We learnt more about databases and the processes involved in making large scale systems. We learnt about how things get complex when scaled up. Planning in advanced using E-R diagram is essential.

## Technologies used
